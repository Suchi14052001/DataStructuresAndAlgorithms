Inbuilt sort function -> O(nLogn)
Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort -> O(n^2)
Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort -> O(nLogn)

#include <algorithm>

Sort an array containing N integers
sort(arr, arr +n)

Sort a vector containing N integers
sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())

Inbuilt sort function uses introsort
Introsort begins with quicksort, it switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on 
(the logarithm of) the number of elements being sorted and it switches to insertion sort when the number of 
elements is below some threshold
