Negative Numbers are stored as 2 compliment
Most Significant Bit 1 represents that its a negative number

For the example, 
11111111111111111111111111111111
If you take 2s compliment of remaining 31 bits ie invert all bits and add one,
You will get 1, and since MSB is 1 so this number represents -1
