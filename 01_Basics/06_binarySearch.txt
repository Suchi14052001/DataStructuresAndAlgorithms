* Binary search is a divide and conquer algorithm
* Efficient searching algorithm to find index of an element in a sorted input array 
* We reduce the size of array /2 each time. Finally we end up with either one or zero elements
* Number of steps taken to approach the final result is log N to the base 2. Hence has logarithmic complexity
* For us to apply binary search, we should have monotonic search space
* Monotonic search space means that using binary search space, in some way you can discard either right part or left part
* Binary search can be applied on non-decreasing or non-increasing functions
* Ternary search does more comparisons than binary search in worst case
