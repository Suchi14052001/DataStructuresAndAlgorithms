* Recursion executes in depth first manner (Left to Right)
* Should have base case and recursive case
   * To define a function "Go to home",
     Base case:      If you are already at home, stop moving
     Recursive case: Take one step towards home, call "Go to home"
* Calls to functions will be stored in the call stack. After returning, stack frames get popped out one by one from above
* To solve a recursive problem
   * Figure out the smallest case
   * Always assume that the subproblem will get solved
   * Solve the current problem assuming subproblem solution exists
