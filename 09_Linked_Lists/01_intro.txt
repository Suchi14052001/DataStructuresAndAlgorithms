* Nodes can be allocated dynamically, When large linear memory is not available - this can be used
* Useful in graph related problems, Newslist in a Facebook feed
* Node is created in heap memory
* Addresses will be hexadecimal addresses

template<typename T> // T is the datatype of elements stored in Linked list
class Node{
	T data;
	Node<T> *next;
	
	public:
		Node(T data){
			this->data = data;
			next = NULL;
		}
}

Node<int> *n = new Node<int>(10); // To create a node in main

* Runner technique to find midpoint of a node - Generally used in Linked lists 
  Have two runners - fast runner and slow runner
  - Fast runner runs at 2X speed and slow runner runs at X speed. 
  - So when fast runner reaches the end of the linked list, slow runner reaches midpoint of the linked list
