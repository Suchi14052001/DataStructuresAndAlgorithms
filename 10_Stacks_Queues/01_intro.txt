Stacks, Queues and Deque (Doubly ended Queue)

1. Stack can mean implicit stack (call stack) or explicit stack
   LIFO	
   Push is an O(1) operation
   Pop is also O(1) operation
   Top gives the topmost element - O(1) operation
   
2. Queue
   FIFO
   Front and rear of the queue
   Insertion of new data happens at the rear end of the queue
   Popping at the front end of the queue
   Push - O(1) operation, Pop - O(1) operation, Front - O(1) operation
   
3. Deque 
   Can perform insertion and deletion at both the ends
   Has two pointers front and rear
   Push_Back, Pop_Back, Push_Front, Pop_Front
   Front and Back methods to look at which element is present at Front and Back respectively
   Can be useful in sliding window type of problems
   
Iterative solutions to recursive problems can be written using stack
Problems involving trees and graphs make extensive use of queues especially BFS or level order traversal
